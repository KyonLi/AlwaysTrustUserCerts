# Always Trust User Certs

This module makes all installed user certificates part of the system certificate store, so that they will automatically be used when building the trust chain. This module makes it unnecessary to add the network_security_config property to an application's manifest.

Features:

* Support for multiple users
* Support for Magisk/KernelSU/KernelSU Next
* Support for devices with and without mainline/conscrypt updates

Depending on your Android version and Google Play Security Update version, your certificates will be either stored in `/system/etc/security/cacerts` or in `/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts/`. This module handles all scenarios and works on any device from Android 7 until Android 16.

## Usage

### Installing certificates

1. Convert the certificate to DER format.

```shell
openssl x509 -in ca.pem -out ca.crt -outform DER
```

2. Rename the certificate file.

```shell
mv ca.crt $(openssl x509 -inform DER -in ca.crt -subject_hash_old -noout).0
```

3. Copy the renamed certificate to /data/adb/cacerts and restart the device.

### Removing certificates

Remove the certificate from /data/adb/cacerts and restart the device.
